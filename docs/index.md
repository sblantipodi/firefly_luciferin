### In this release:
- ***Breaking changes***: requires `Glow Worm Luciferin` firmware (v5.12.9).
- **Introducing the Luciferin surround lighting with satellites.**
- **Added Wayland support for Linux.** Thanks @h7io for the contribution to this feature.

  when PC and ESP lives in separate VLANs/Subnets.
- **Added the possibility to average the color of the screen on all the LEDs**.
- **Big performance improvements for Linux while running on X11.**
- **Added an optimization for Linux users that is specific for NVIDIA GPUs.** Thanks to @Phoshi for the support on this
  feature.

  icon starts/stops screen capture, right left click opens the menu as usual. (Windows only, Linux version has no tray
  bar).
- Added an option during the installation process to create a desktop shortcut to Firefly Luciferin (Windows only).
- Added an option during the installation process to create a start menu shortcut to Firefly Luciferin (Windows only).
- Potential off-heap memory leak on Linux. Fixed. Thanks @jypma for fixing this issue.
- Firefly Luciferin caused a brief audio stutter on some systems during startup. Fixed.
- Fixed sporadic crashes on ESP32-S3 devices.
- Fixed an issue that prevented Glow Worm Luciferin firmware to be flashed using external tools like esptool.

### In the previous release:

  affects Firefly Luciferin only, there is no need to update the firmware.**.
