                <p>Breaking changes: requires Glow Worm Luciferin firmware (v5.21.3)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The smoothing feature is greatly improved thanks to the Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
                        
                        EMA is a smoothing technique that gradually adjusts values over time, giving more weight to
                        recent data while still considering past values. Unlike a simple average, EMA reacts faster
                        to changes while still keeping transitions smooth. By combining Frame Generation and EMA, Luciferin delivers an even more natural and immersive ambient lighting effect while
                        keeping system performance efficient.
                    </li>
                    <li>Home Assistant integration has been updated to make room for this new feature:
                        <ul>
                            <li>select.luciferin_smoothing_level entity has been removed.</li>
                            <li>select.luciferin_frame_generation has been added.</li>
                            <li>select.luciferin_smoothing_ema has been added.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eye care features has been extended:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Night light: Use warmer colors to block blue light. The higher you raise the level, the
                                more blue light will be blocked. The 'Auto' setting syncs with the night light setting
                                in your operating system.
                            </li>
                            <li>Luminosity threshold: Added the option to customize the threshold value for this
                                feature.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Color temperature correction
                        algorithm has been improved, now it does not reduce brightness on faint colors.
                    </li>
                    <li>Optimize PIPEWIREXDG pipeline. Thanks @Ape.
                    </li>
                    <li>The firmware now smooths out transitions when switching from one color to another in solid mode.
                        (Full firmware only).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Test image
                        improvements:
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can now access other settings while using Test Image.</li>
                            <li>Every change is now reflected in real time by the test image.</li>
                            <li>The test image now allows for 4 levels of saturation (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%). This helps
                                to test colors with various levels of saturation.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can now open the Info menu along with the Settings menu. This allows you to check in real
                        time how changing settings affects FPS, without having to swap back and forth between the
                        Settings and Info menus.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Net code overhead reduction for reduced power usage.
                    </li>
                    <li>Small UI reorganizations and improvements and better handling of the info tooltips.</li>
                    <li>Restarting capture due to a framerate change is now much faster.</li>
                    <li>Added support for 4.000.000 and 6.000.000 baud rates for newer UART chips. Use with caution.
                    </li>
                    <li>Home assistant brightness control not working with Bias light. Fixed. </li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that reverted the baud rate to 115.200 when changing network settings.</li>
                    <li>Tray icon update menu does not work when Check for updates is disabled. Fixed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Settings cannot be opened when the MQTT server is unreachable. Issue resolved.</li>
                    <li>Following a recent change in Home Assistant, the light entity is no longer recognized as an RGB entity. Fixed.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <description>
                <p>Breaking changes: requires Glow Worm Luciferin firmware (v5.18.2)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The priority of UDP packets in wireless mode has been increased to signal to the router that
                        Luciferin traffic requires lower latency than standard packets.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the microcontroller is temporarily disconnected from the WiFi network, Firefly Luciferin is
                        now able to reconnect much faster without restarting the screen capture.
                    </li>
                    <li>Added a 'bottom' capture option for satellites when the LEDs are configured to use a bottom
                        gap.
                    </li>
                    <li>The save state has been restructured. Auto-save has been disabled to prevent wear on the
                        microcontroller's memory.
                    </li>
                    <li>Arch Linux package. Note: AUR package is built from the official sources but it's currently
                        maintained by @Ape. Thanks @Ape for this.
                    </li>
                    <li>Libasound2t64 dependency prevents correct installation on some Linux distros. Closes #253.</li>
                    <li>Properly handle expired restore token on Wayland. Thanks @Ape for the PR.</li>
                    <li>Logging improvements. Thanks @Ape for the PR.</li>
                    <li>Proper config path on Linux. Config file and logs has been moved in XDG_CONFIG_HOME
                        (~/.config/FireflyLuciferin). Old config files will be automatically moved to the new path.
                    </li>
                    <li>The snap version was crashing at startup when there were temporary files created by other instances of Firefly Luciferin on the system. Fixed.</li>

            <url type="details">https://github.com/sblantipodi/firefly_luciferin/releases/tag/v2.18.9</url>
            <description>
                <p>Breaking changes: requires Glow Worm Luciferin firmware (v5.17.8)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Capture pipeline has been optimized for DX12 on Windows. Previously, under heavy GPU load, capture framerates would drop significantly, causing occasional LED stuttering. Now, the pipeline has been restructured to better utilize hardware resources, completely eliminating stuttering. This change, along with the previous SIMD extension released with the previous version of Firefly Luciferin, makes Luciferin one of the most optimized and fastest software for bias lighting available at the moment.</li>
                    <li>New effects and improvements to the existing ones.</li>
                    <li>Firefly Luciferin is now able to run on a Linux sandbox like Flatpak and Snap.</li>
                    <li>The response latency during Linux screen capture has been widely reduced.</li>
                    <li>Added a Tray icon and minimize to tray on Linux. Thanks @sorcererlc for the continued support.
                    </li>
                    <li>New non intrusive notification system on Linux.</li>
                    <li>The Info menu now displays the current CPU latency. Lower values indicate better performance.
                        This value can be influenced by your screen resolution, capture area dimensions, CPU/RAM
                        overclocking, and AVX extensions available on the CPU.
                    </li>
                    <li>Home Assistant: Luciferin entities are now grouped under one devices.</li>
                    <li>Update notifications are now less intrusive and no longer launch the update popup at computer startup. A simple notification informs about the available update, and you can proceed to install it by right-clicking on the tray icon and selecting 'install updates'.</li>
                    <li>Linux Wayland didn't ask you which screen to record when the recording permission expired.
                        Fixed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Power saving mode is not interrupted by small changes on the screen like icons changing state in the system tray or incoming notifications.</li>
